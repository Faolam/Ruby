Ruby Assignment Operators
Assume variable a holds 10 and variable b holds 20, then âˆ’

Operator	Description	Example
=	Simple assignment operator, assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.	c = a + b will assign the value of a + b into c
+=	Add AND assignment operator, adds right operand to the left operand and assign the result to left operand.	c += a is equivalent to c = c + a
-=	Subtract AND assignment operator, subtracts right operand from the left operand and assign the result to left operand.	c -= a is equivalent to c = c - a
*=	Multiply AND assignment operator, multiplies right operand with the left operand and assign the result to left operand.	c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a
/=	Divide AND assignment operator, divides left operand with the right operand and assign the result to left operand.	c /= a is equivalent to c = c / a
%=	Modulus AND assignment operator, takes modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand.	c %= a is equivalent to c = c % a
**=	Exponent AND assignment operator, performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the left operand.	c **= a is equivalent to c = c ** a
