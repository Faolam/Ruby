Ruby Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operator works on bits and performs bit by bit operation.

Assume if a = 60; and b = 13; now in binary format they will be as follows âˆ’

 a    =  0011 1100
 b    =  0000 1101
 ------------------
 a&b  =  0000 1100
 a|b  =  0011 1101
 a^b  =  0011 0001
 ~a   =  1100 0011
The following Bitwise operators are supported by Ruby language.

Operator	Description	Example
&	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands.	(a & b) will give 12, which is 0000 1100
|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand.	(a | b) will give 61, which is 0011 1101
^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.	(a ^ b) will give 49, which is 0011 0001
~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.	(~a ) will give -61, which is 1100 0011 in 2's complement form due to a signed binary number.
<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	a << 2 will give 240, which is 1111 0000
>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.	a >> 2 will give 15, which is 0000 1111
