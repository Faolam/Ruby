Ruby Parallel Assignment
Ruby also supports the parallel assignment of variables. This enables multiple variables to be initialized with a single line of Ruby code. For example −

a = 10
b = 20
c = 30
This may be more quickly declared using parallel assignment −

a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
Parallel assignment is also useful for swapping the values held in two variables −

a, b = b, c


=end
